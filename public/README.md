## HDR Environment Map

The application requires an HDR environment map file named `studio_small_09_1k.hdr` to be placed in this directory. This file is used for realistic lighting and reflections in the 3D scene.

You can obtain an HDR environment map from various sources:
1. Use the original file from the project
2. Download free HDR maps from websites like [HDRIHaven](https://hdrihaven.com/)
3. Create your own HDR environment map

Place the file in this directory and ensure it's named `studio_small_09_1k.hdr` or update the path in the `ballpit.tsx` component.
